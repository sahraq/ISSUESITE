        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p>Somalia has one of the highest rates of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in the world, with <strong>98%</strong> of women and girls aged 15-49 having undergone the procedure. Most of these procedures are performed between the ages of <strong>5 and 11</strong>. The most common type practiced is Type III (infibulation), which is the most severe form of cutting.</p>

        <h2>Health Risks Associated with FGM</h2>
        <p>The practice poses significant health risks, contributing to increased maternal and newborn mortality rates. Women who have undergone FGM are at a greater risk of suffering complications during childbirth, including hemorrhaging and obstructed labor, leading to higher maternal mortality rates. In fact, FGM increases the risk of childbirth complications by <strong>50%</strong> and newborn deaths by up to <strong>55%</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Long-Term Health Consequences</h2>
        <p>FGM is also linked to a range of chronic health issues, such as urinary infections, chronic pain, cysts, and infertility. Studies indicate that approximately <strong>30%</strong> of women who have undergone FGM experience complications that require medical attention later in life.</p>
