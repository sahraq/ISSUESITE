            <h2>Dr. Leyla Hussein's Story</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Leyla Hussein, a psychotherapist and FGM survivor, underwent female genital mutilation at the age of seven. She recounts the traumatic experience of being held down and cut, leading to severe psychological and emotional repercussions. Despite living in the UK since the age of 12, it wasn't until a nurse asked her about FGM during a routine check-up that she realized the connection between her past and her health struggles. This moment inspired her to become an activist against FGM and advocate for survivors through her organization, The Dahlia Project. Dr. Hussein's journey highlights the importance of awareness and support for those affected by this harmful practice.

                Today, she works tirelessly to raise awareness and provide therapeutic support for FGM survivors, emphasizing the need for medical professionals to ask patients about their experiences with FGM in a sensitive manner. Her story illustrates the lasting impact of FGM and the necessity of conversations around this issue to empower other survivors.
